# ⭐ BasicMathFunctions

🚀 Create a simple Python module that provides implementations of common mathematical and logical functions such as **Armstrong number check, Fibonacci series, Factorial calculation, and Binary-to-Decimal conversion , etc**.  
- This project is designed for beginners to understand how these algorithms work in Python.
- This project extended by me in future including other functions.
- because of making a module , It is easier to apply all funtions directly.

#👣 Steps  
👉 1. import this module (import my_module) , After that
            2. You can use all funtions . (my_module.fib) ,(my_module.fact) , etc

## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Check if a number is an Armstrong number  
- ✅ Generate Fibonacci series up to `n` terms  
- 🚀 Calculate factorial of a number  
- ✅ Convert binary numbers to decimal  
- ✅ Convert decimal numbers to binary
